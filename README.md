# LongerDays

"LongerDays" allows adjustment of the time intervals for the default day and night cycles on your Spigot server. This was requested by a friend of mine for personal use, but I figured it could also be uploaded for public use.

## Installation:
1. Copy LongerDays.jar into your /plugins directory
2. Start your server
3. Edit your [config.yml](src/main/resources/config.yml)

### Configuration:
- day - integer (minutes) for day cycle
- night - integer (minutes) for night cycle
- worlds - string list of world names in which to enable this plugin

## Support:
If you run into any server performance problems, or if the plugin is not working as advertised (console errors, bugs, etc.), please do not hesitate to contact me, post in the discussion thread, or open an issue on GitHub.
